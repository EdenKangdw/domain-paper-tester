The question is asking about the key clinical features associated with atrial fibrillation in patients presenting with stroke.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the provided word list: what, are, the, key, clinical, features, associated, with, a, diagnosis, of, atrial, fibrillation, in, patients, presenting, with, stroke.\n\nI need to select words that are crucial for understanding the core. So, starting from \"What\" and \"are,\" but those are more general. \"Key\" is important because it indicates which features are being discussed. \"Clinical\" refers to medical aspects, so that's relevant. Features are specific indicators or signs related to a condition.\n\n\"Associated with\" shows the relationship between atrial fibrillation and another factor. \"Atrial\" and \"fibrillation\" specify the condition. \"In patients presenting with stroke\" gives context about who we're looking at. So combining these, I think the key words are: features (since they're the focus), associated (to show the relationship), and in (to specify the population). \n\nSo the evidence_words would be ['features', 'associated', 'in']. These words help frame the question as asking about specific medical indicators linked to atrial fibrillation among stroke patients.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n    \"evidence_words\": [\"features\", \"associated\", \"in\"],\n    \"explanation\": \"The words 'features' indicate what aspects are being examined, 'associated' shows the relationship between atrial fibrillation and another condition or characteristic, and 'in' specifies the group of patients under consideration (those presenting with stroke).\"\n}\n```"

    "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, so I have this query where someone is asking me to extract key evidence words from a medical question about AI in patient diagnosis and treatment. They've given a specific word list and some guidelines.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what exactly they're looking for. The question is asking about the primary ethical considerations when using AI in diagnosis and treatment. So, my task is to pick out the most important words that capture the essence of this query.\n\nLooking at the provided word list: \"Describe, the, primary, ethical, considerations, associated, with, the, use, of, artificial, intelligence, in, patient, diagnosis, and, treatment.\"\n\nI need to focus on crucial terms. The main components are \"ethical considerations,\" which is a key phrase here because that's what the question is about. Then, I should include terms related to AI specificallyâ€”like \"artificial intelligence\" or maybe its abbreviation if provided, but since it's not in the list, I'll go with \"intelligence.\" \n\nThe context involves patient diagnosis and treatment, so words like \"diagnosis,\" \"treatment,\" and \"patient\" are important. They help specify where the AI is being applied.\n\nNow, considering the guidelines: prioritize technical terms from the medical domain. Words like \"ethical considerations\" might be more general, but in this case, it's crucial because that's exactly what the question is asking for. Including \"artificial intelligence\" or its abbreviation ensures we're focusing on the specific technology involved.\n\nI should make sure I'm not missing any words that are pivotal to understanding the core of the question. Words like \"primary\" emphasize importance, so including that might be useful, but sometimes it's about the main focus rather than just a modifier.\n\nPutting it all together: The key evidence words would likely be \"ethical considerations,\" \"artificial intelligence,\" and either \"diagnosis\" or \"treatment.\" But looking at the word list again, both \"diagnosis\" and \"treatment\" are present. Since the question covers both areas, maybe including both makes sense. However, the guidelines say to prioritize technical terms, so perhaps one is more important than the other.\n\nWait, actually, the primary focus is on both diagnosis and treatment as contexts for using AI ethically. So it's better to include both. But looking back at the example response provided earlier, they included \"diagnosis\" in their answer. Since both are part of the context, maybe including both would capture all necessary aspects.\n\nSo my final selection might be: \"ethical considerations,\" \"artificial intelligence,\" and either \"diagnosis\" or \"treatment.\" Let me check if that's within the word list. Yes, they're all there.\n\nI think I should go with \"ethical considerations,\" \"artificial intelligence,\" and both \"diagnosis\" and \"treatment\" to cover all aspects mentioned in the question.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n    \"evidence_words\": [\"ethical\", \"considerations\", \"artificial\", \"intelligence\"],\n    \"explanation\": \"The words 'ethical' and 'considerations' are crucial as they directly relate to the primary ethical concerns.

The question is about identifying the most common side effects associated with long-term use of Metformin for Type 2 Diabetes management. They've also provided a list of words they want included.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the core of the question is. The main goal here seems to be finding side effects related to Metformin and its use in managing Type 2 Diabetes over time. So I should focus on terms like \"side effects\" since that's directly relevant. \n\nLooking at the provided word list: List, the, most, common, side, effects, associated, with, long-term, use, of, Metformin, for, Type, 2, Diabetes, management.\n\nI need to pick words that are crucial for understanding the question. \"Side\" and \"effects\" are definitely essential because they directly refer to what's being asked about. Then, since it's about common side effects in long-term use, \"common\", \"long-term\", and \"use\" would be important too. \n\nThe word \"associated\" might also be relevant as it connects the side effects with Metformin or diabetes, but I think including more specific terms like \"side effects\" and \"long-term\" will make the query clearer. So, maybe selecting List isn't necessary since that's just a command. The key domain-specific terms are side effects, long-term use, Metformin, Type 2 Diabetes.\n\nWait, in the initial selection, I included \"most\", which refers to quantity, and \"common\", which is about frequency. These help narrow down the focus to the primary concerns of the question. \n\nSo putting it together, the evidence words would be side effects (core term), long-term use (time frame), Metformin (the medication), Type 2 Diabetes (specific condition), and possibly common or most as well.\n\nBut looking back at the user's initial selection, they included \"List\", which I think is not needed since it's a command. So focusing on side effects, associated, effects, long-term, use, of, Metformin, for, Type, 2, Diabetes. \n\nI think including all these makes sense because each word contributes to understanding the query's structure and what exactly is being asked.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n    \"evidence_words\": [\"side\", \"effects\", \"long-term\", \"use\"],\n    \"explanation\": \"The terms 'side' and 'effects' directly refer to the question about side effects.
