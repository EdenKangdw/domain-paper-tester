Enhancement of anti-tumor T cell response:**\n\n* Inhibits inhibitory receptors on T cells, unleashing cytotoxic and proliferative capabilities.\n* Promotes the expansion and functionality of effector T cells.\n\n\n**2. Modulation of tumor-immune cell interaction:**\n\n* Increases the proportion of effector T cells in the tumor microenvironment.\n* Reduces the abundance of regulatory T cells (Tregs), which dampen immune responses.\n* Promotes tumor cell killing and immune surveillance.\n\n\n**3. Activation of tumor-specific immune response:**\n\n* Stimulates the production of tumor antigens by dendritic cells.\n* Promotes the development of memory T cells, enhancing long-term protection.\n* Induces durable clinical responses by targeting immunosuppressive pathways.\n\n\n**4. Induction of immune-mediated effector pathways:**\n\n* Triggers the release of cytokines and chemokines that amplify the immune response.\n* Promotes the production of cytotoxic molecules and phagocytes for tumor cell destruction.\n* Increases the efficacy of other immunotherapies by enhancing the overall immune response.\n\n\n**5.
